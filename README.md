# UAT "Designing Website Interfaces" Class Repository

## Projects:

- PHP & Vanilla Website
  - Objective was to create a very basic website in PHP, HTML, CSS, and JS, to review and practice concepts taught in previous classes and to get introduced to PHP. So, this website processes form data using PHP with simple PHP & JS sanitization & validation.
- NOTE: If your a student, feel free to use the code and make any changes as you see fit. You will need to add your own images if unavailable at the time you cloned this repo, I will be removing them from the repository due to limits imposed by GitHub.
